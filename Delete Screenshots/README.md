# Delete Screenshots Within N Days

This Alfred workflow helps to delete screenshots taken or modified within the last N days in the Downloads folder. 

## Usage

You can use it with a keyword parameter and an optional argument to move screenshots to trash.

1. 'deletescreenshots' to delete screenshots within 1 day (Default)
2. 'deletescreenshots {query}' to delete screenshots within the last N days

**Note:** This workflow uses AppleScript to move screenshots to Bin. Bash scripts alternatives are also provided if deleting screenshots without moving to bin is preferred.
